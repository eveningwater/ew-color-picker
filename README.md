      },//the handler of sure
      clear:function(){
          console.log(this)
      },//the handler of clear
      togglePicker:(el,flag,context) => {
        console.log('current root element',el);
        console.log('current color picker',context);
        if(flag){
            console.log("opened");
        }else{
            console.log("closed");
        }
      },//Click the box event callback, you need to pay attention to the event trigger must be set `hasBox` to true 
      isLog:false, //Whether to turn on printing information, the default is true if the value is not specified
      changeColor:(color) => {
        console.log('the color value changed:',color);
      },
      hasBox:true //The default is true, or false, indicating whether to display the box
      isClickOutside:true, //The default is true, or false,Indicates whether it is allowed to click outside the colorPicker area to close the colorPicker

  ewColorPicker.getDefaultConfig();
  //For the instantiated color picker class, we also provide 3 APIs, as follows:
  color.openPicker(pickerAnimation,time);//Open the color picker manually, the parameter is the animation type, namely `height` or `opacity`
  color.closePicker(pickerAnimation,time);//Manually close the color picker, the parameters are the same as the manual open method
  color.updateColor(color);//Manually update the color value, the parameter is the color value, the unqualified color value will give an error prompt, and the color picker panel must be open

## use in component


```js
   import ewColorPicker from 'ewColorPicker';
   import "ew-color-picker/dist/ew-color-picker.min.css"
   import "ew-color-picker/src/style/ew-color-picker.css"
   var pluginName = new ewColorPicker(option);//option is the configuration object, see above for details

```
> tips: It should be noted that starting from version 1.6.4, if there are multiple dom elements passed in, only the first dom element will be rendered as a colorPicker. If multiple colorPickers need to be rendered, an array can be used for instance. E.g:
```js
   let els = document.querySelectorAll('.demo');
   els.forEach(item => {
     new ewColorPicker(item);
     //or new ewColorPicker({
    //  el:item,
    //  }) //and the configuration
   })
```
