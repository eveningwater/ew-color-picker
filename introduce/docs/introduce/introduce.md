## scenes to be used

This color picker is suitable for small and medium-sized projects, such as theme switching. Different from the colorPicker component in the component library, its configuration is autonomous and customized according to the needs of users.

## Features

The style of html5's native color picker is not good-looking, but the color picker of the component library is not flexible enough. In this way, this color picker was born.
